🏥 Health Monitoring Agent

A Lightweight System for Compressing Medical Data & Providing Personalized Health Recommendations

📌 Project Overview

The Health Monitoring Agent is a Python-based intelligent system designed to:

Collect medical history and wellness data

Compress and optimize health data storage

Analyze health metrics using lightweight Machine Learning models

Provide personalized health recommendations

Reduce processing and computational cost

This project focuses on building an efficient and scalable health monitoring solution suitable for low-resource environments.

🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare applications generate large volumes of data including:

Medical history

Vital signs

Lifestyle data

Daily wellness tracking

Processing this data using heavy AI models increases:

Storage requirements

Processing time

Computational costs

This project solves that problem using data compression techniques and lightweight ML models.

🚀 Features

✅ Medical history collection (BP, sugar, BMI, diseases, medications)
✅ Daily wellness tracking (steps, sleep, heart rate, calories)
✅ Data compression using feature selection & summarization
✅ Efficient storage using SQLite / JSON
✅ Lightweight ML model (Decision Tree / Logistic Regression)
✅ Personalized health recommendations
✅ Beginner-friendly code structure

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI)

Database: SQLite

Data Processing: Pandas

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Frontend: HTML, CSS

🧠 How Data Compression Reduces Cost

This system reduces processing costs by:

Removing unnecessary features

Summarizing historical data

Using optimized data types in Pandas

Avoiding deep learning models

Running completely locally (no cloud dependency)

This results in:

✔ Lower memory usage
✔ Faster processing
✔ Reduced storage requirement
✔ Better scalability

📊 Sample Health Metrics Used

Age

Weight

Height

BMI

Blood Pressure

Blood Sugar

Heart Rate

Sleep Hours

Steps Count

🤖 Machine Learning Approach

The system uses lightweight models such as:

Decision Tree

Logistic Regression

These models are selected because:

They require less computational power

They are interpretable

They are suitable for structured health data

📈 Future Improvements

Add real-time wearable device integration

Implement dashboard visualization

Add user authentication

Deploy on cloud (AWS / Azure / GCP)

Improve recommendation engine with ensemble models
